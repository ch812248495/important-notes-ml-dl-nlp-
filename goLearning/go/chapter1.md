# Introduction of go grammer

Golang likes C, but its compiling speed is quite fast, only 25  keywords are reserved.

```
break    default      func    interface    select
case     defer        go      map          struct
chan     else         goto    package      switch
const    fallthrough  if      range        type
continue for          import  return       var
```

So, let us enter the world of golang and have a taste for its syntax.
